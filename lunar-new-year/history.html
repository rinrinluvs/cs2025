                    <p class="desc">Lunar New Year or Tet is one of the most important celebrations in many Asian cultures. It follows the lunar calendar, meaning its date shifts each year between late January and mid-February.
                        The holiday’s origins trace back over 4,000 years to ancient China during the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BCE). According to tradition, it marked the end of winter and the beginning of a new agricultural cycle. Early myths tell of Nian, a monster that would attack villages at the start of the new year, only to be scared away by loud noises, fire, and the color red—which is why fireworks, lanterns, and red decorations are central to celebrations today.</p>
